Objective

The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your frontend and backend development skills, along with your ability to work with containerization, API design, database management, and CI/CD pipelines. The estimated time to complete the assignment is 2-3 days however you may take a maximum of one week from the date of receiving this assignment.

**Assignment Overview**

You are required to develop a task management web application with the following features: Core Requirements:

**1\. User Authentication & Authorization**

○ Implement signup/login functionality using JWT-based authentication. ○ Users should be able to create an account, log in, and manage their sessions securely.

**2\. Task Management**

○ Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks. (Example: Product Inventory Hub to edit products)

○ Users should only be able to access and modify their own tasks.

**3\. Frontend Development**

○ Build a responsive web application using React, Vue, or Angular.

○ Use Redux, Vuex, or Context API for state management.

○ Implement form validation and error handling.

**4\. Backend Development**

○ Use Node.js (Express.js) or Python (Django/FastAPI) to develop the backend API. ○ Implement RESTful API endpoints for authentication and task management. ○ Ensure proper request validation and error handling.

**5\. Database Management**

○ Use PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB to store user and task data.

○ Use ORM such as Sequelize, Prisma, or Mongoose for database interactions. ○ Add database seed scripts to create the DB with tables

**6\. Containerization & DevOps**

○ Dockerize the application using Docker and Docker Compose.

○ Provide a Dockerfile for the backend and frontend.

○ Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins to automate builds and tests.  
**Bonus (Optional but Preferred)**

● Implement Task Notifications (via WebSockets, email, or push notifications). ● Write Unit and Integration Tests using Jest, Mocha, or PyTest.

● Deploy the application on a cloud platform (AWS/GCP/Azure) with a CI/CD pipeline. ● Use Kubernetes for container orchestration.

Submission Guidelines:

● Submit the source code via a GitHub repository (ensure it is public or provide access). ● Include a README.md with the following details:

○ Setup instructions.

○ API documentation.

○ Any assumptions or decisions made.

● Ensure the application is fully functional and tested before submission.

Evaluation Criteria:

1\. Code Quality & Best Practices (Clean, modular, maintainable code) 2\. Frontend Implementation (UI/UX, state management, responsiveness) 3\. Backend API Design (Security, efficiency, error handling)

4\. Database Schema & Queries (Optimization, indexing, ORM usage)

5\. Containerization & CI/CD (Proper Dockerization, automated workflows) 6\. Testing & Documentation (Unit tests, API documentation, setup instructions)
